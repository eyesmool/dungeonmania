# Blogging

For this assignment, each individual will need to complete two blog posts:

- One of these is an individual blog which briefly outlines what you as an individual did in each week. You should fill the entry once a week during that week, not all at the very end. [Here is a template for the entries](/Individual_Blog_YOUR_NAME_HERE.md). We have included a single copy of this template in your repository.
  - Make enough copies of the template in your repository for each person in the group.
  - Each person should rename their own file, changing `YOUR_NAME_HERE` to their name.
- The other is a shared blog which will contain answers to the questions in Task 1, as well as designs for Task 2 and issues identified in Task 3. [Here is a template for this blog post](/Pair_Blog_Template.md). We have included a copy of this template as `Pair_Blog.md` in your repository.

You are permitted to use a Google Doc or some other collaborative text editor to work on your pair blog, and copy the template onto that doc.

These blogs must be added to your pair repository.
You are permitted to upload the blogs in pdf, markdown, or any other legible text format which supports links.
