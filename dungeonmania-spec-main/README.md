What is this assignment aiming to achieve?

While in Assignment I you developed a system from scratch, in this Assignment you will be developing a system that has been started by someone else. You’ll need to analyse and refactor the code in the monolith repository we’ve provided, and then adapt the solution to an evolution in the requirements.

The aims of this assignment can be broken down into five major themes:

1. **Acclimatising to an existing system.** For many of you this will be the largest codebase you have worked on to date - which can be very daunting! Being able to work with a system that you haven’t built from scratch and don’t fully understand is a vital skill, since software is never developed in isolation.
2. **Refactoring Techniques.** Like when you go camping, you always want to leave the code in a better state than you found it in. We’ve intentionally put in a series of design flaws, with accompanying design smells for you to discover and refactor.
3. **Design Patterns.** Being able to see patterns in existing code, and to use patterns to improve code quality is an essential skill in a Software Engineer. You’ll have the chance to do this and apply the theoretical ideas discussed in lectures.
4. **Evolution of Requirements.** Software is never static - it always evolves and grows as do its requirements. You’ll need to build on the existing system to accommodate for these changes, in doing so undergo an iterative design and development process.
5. **Dealing with The Unknown.** There are many unknowns in this assignment that you and your partner will encounter. You will need to explore and investigate together, clarify and ask for help where needed and approach these unknowns with grace in order to succeed.

This spec is split into **two** parts.
The first part contains the requirements the existing MVP we've provided was built to.
The second part contains your tasks you'll need to complete for this assignment.

1. [Product Specification - MVP](MVP.md)
